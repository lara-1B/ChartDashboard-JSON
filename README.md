Widget Dashboard
A customizable widget dashboard application that allows users to create, manage, and visualize data through various types of charts. The app provides a user-friendly interface to add widgets with different chart types, select colors, and automatically generate data for visualization.

Features
Custom Widget Creation: Users can create widgets with different chart types (e.g., Bar, Pie, Doughnut, Line, Bubble, Horizontal Line).
Color Selection: Up to 5 colors can be selected for each chart to customize the appearance.
Automatic Data Generation: Random data and labels are generated automatically for each chart.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
State Management: Widgets are managed using Redux, ensuring smooth data flow across the application.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing the widget data.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
React-Redux: Official React bindings for Redux.
Chart.js: A flexible JavaScript charting library for data visualization.
